title: "More About Me"

Hi! My name is Samiha Farooqi, and I am currently studying data science and history at The George Washington University in Washington D.C.. In my courses, I’ve utilized data visualization and data analytics to complement my research into social phenomena and issues—for example, I analyzed the social impacts of the ‘Striketober’ events in the Fall of 2021. And in a different final project in one of my data visualization classes, I attempted to answer the following question: in what ways has the average American fared over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic? Using a series of maps, graphs, and statistical figures derived from several data sets—such as the American Community Survey—I analyzed the pandemic's impact on poverty, and what factors contributed to those changes. It is this sort of work that lies at the intersection of data science and social research that I'm most interested in.
