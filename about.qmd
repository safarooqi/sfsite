My name is Samiha Farooqi, and as a student journalist studying data science and history at The George Washington University, I've utilized data visualization and data analytics to complement original research and reporting into social phenomena/issues. For example, I analyzed the social impacts of the 'Striketober' events in the Fall of 2021 using data primarily from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This supplemented various interviews, including with Joseph McCartin, a professor of U.S. Labor, Social, and Political History at Georgetown University, a local public school teacher in Fairfax County, VA, and a healthcare worker at a DMV branch of Kaiser Permanente. It is at this intersection of data analytics and reporting that I'm most interested in as I continue my studies.
