<p>As her lunch break neared its end, Ismat Kumar rushed to head back to her office to clock back in. A healthcare worker at Kaiser Permanente in Northern Virginia, Kumar is more than used to the hustle and bustle that comes with working in medicine. In the 21 months since the COVID-19 pandemic began, however, it's becoming unbearable.</p>
<p>Since March 2020, Kumar said that Kaiser has made a number of controversial decisions for their staff. Lunch breaks have been shortened. Employees are now required to clock in and out for lunch. Overtime forms must be filled out every time a patient's appointment runs late. Fed up, Kumar says a number of her coworkers have quit or found new jobs—only adding to the stress of those who remain.</p>
<p>"Management will thank us, they'll call us heroes—all while benefits are being taken away," said Kumar. "They will listen to our complaints, but they won’t do anything about them," she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Kumar is experiencing right now is not uncommon. As the pandemic has raged on across the nation, and around the world, millions of workers have been faced with a stifling workplace. As Joseph McCartin, a professor of U.S. Labor, Social, and Political History at Georgetown University said, "as we’re coming out of the pandemic, workers' expectations and desires regarding their jobs have changed a lot."</p>
<p>McCartin added that this phenomenon, called "the Great resignation," is largely a "worker driven labor shortage." Generally, workers are becoming more and more fed up with the conditions of their workplaces. Having constantly been called "heroes" without seeing an increase in their wages or benefits, many have either chosen to strike, or seek work elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is all occurring alongside what has been called "Striketober," and moving into November and December, "Strikesgiving" and "Strikesmas." According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/business/economy/strikes-labor-pandemic.html">The New York Times</a>, more than 25,000 workers went on strike in October alone—compared to an average of about 10,000 workers in the previous three months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Striking data collected by the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University <a href="https://striketracker.ilr.cornell.edu/">shows</a> that 45 strikes occurred throughout the month of November. In October, that number was 60; In September, it was 44; And in August, it was 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"In a lot of these cases, people are complaining about the oppressive nature of their work," said McCartin. "And I think that really speaks to a broad shared experience that Americans have linked to the pandemic. This has led people to question whether they want to continue in the patterns that existed prior to the pandemic."</p>
<pre><code>For workers like Kumar, however, striking isn\'t an option due to the nature of her union agreement. Still, more of a \"work/life balance\" is desperately needed. \"Benefits are slowly being chipped away,\" she said.&nbsp;

When Kumar first started working at Kaiser, she said that work was far easier to balance. At that time, there was \"more breathing room.\" Nowadays, it\'s nonstop work.&nbsp;</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to be changed was the lunch hour. Prior to the pandemic, workers at Kumar's Kaiser location had an hour for lunch, and weren't required to clock in and out. If an appointment right before her lunch break went overtime, it wasn't a big deal—she simply went to lunch after. Today, that isn't the case at all.</p>
<p>Now when Kumar wants to head to her lunch break, she must clock out. If an appointment runs late and into her lunch break, she is now required to fill out various overtime forms. She only has 30 minutes for lunch now. If, for example, her lunch for the day is from 1:00 to 1:30, she could very well have an appointment scheduled right at 1:30—leaving her with little time to take a much needed break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have to make myself familiar with a patient's history, clock out, eat lunch, and clock back in, all before the next appointment. Before 2021, we wouldn't be forced to shortchange a patient. Now, we don't have a choice sometimes," Kumar said.</p>
<p>Kumar also said that she, and some of her coworkers, feel they aren't being treated as the professionals they are. "Many of us have more than 20 years of experience in our fields. Now they're asking us to clock in and out for lunch?"</p>
<p>Besides the shortened lunch break, Kumar described a number of other changes that were made to her day-to-day. Prior to the pandemic, it was easier to get coverage if someone needed time-off. Now, only one person can take off per day. If there's a holiday someone needs off, they must let management know at the beginning of the year. In order to call in for vacation time, staff have to let management know four months in advance. "They haven't even put enough mechanisms in place to make sure staff can actually leave," said Kumar.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>She added that staff shortages have severely affected this. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a number of people have resigned. Some even moved out of the country. A year and a half later, those positions still have yet to be filled.&nbsp;

\"Nobody really says anything openly, because what\'s the point? But it\'s getting to be too much. We all love what we do---we really love our patients, and we care about what we do. But we aren\'t machines. We do need time off, and time to just breathe,\" said Kumar.&nbsp;

Maaz Ahmad, a public school teacher in Fairfax, VA, echoed similar experiences. The unions in Ahmad\'s county aren't very strong. This makes it difficult for the unions to actually make things happen. Something like a country-wide strike isn\'t feasible for them to organize. Being a right-to-work state such as Virginia complicates the situation, as unions are further weakened. Still, Ahmad said, \"I assure you, if we announced that we were going to strike, most teachers in our county would do so, and we would completely shut down the county.\"

With the weakening of unions in recent decades, Rebecca Givan, a professor of Labor Studies and Employment Relations at Rutgers University, said,\"it's clear that unions provide tangibly better work for workers. And so when there are fewer unions, workers do suffer.\"</code></pre>
<p>Givan also said that the presence of strikes tends to raise people’s awareness of them. Successful strikes make other workers realize that they could demand more, and receive significant wins. She added that, "in that way, strikes can be described as contagious."</p>
<p>As for the future of unions in the U.S., Givan discussed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842">Protecting the Right to Organize Act</a>—otherwise known as the ProAct—which passed earlier this year in the House of Representatives. "It does a number of things to rebalance labor law, which has become very much tipped towards employers." Givan said that in the last few decades, it has been difficult for employees to organize unions. What the ProAct can also do, is fine employers when they commit what’s called "unfair labor practices."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of things that employers do that are technically not allowed now, but the penalty is so weak that they do them anyway. And so the idea would be to, depending on the incident—on the first incident, or repeat offender—fining $50, and then $100,000," said Givan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She added that this sort of penalty would be significant enough that employers might "think twice" before violating labor law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ProAct has yet to pass in the Senate, however, leaving workers like Ahmad still unable to do much to organize.</p>
<p>Coming out of a difficult period of online schooling paired with the lack of wages, Ahmad also said that this school year has been "difficult." And as time goes on, he and other teachers are becoming more burnt out. "Whenever we go up the food chain and complain about salaries, that complaint is always set up above. That’s why there is such a large exodus of teachers this year who are just fed up. And many of them are looking to find other jobs and other professions, because, one, they get paid more, and two, the professional respect that they get is higher."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahmad added that, "everyone needs to step up," from higher up officials in each county, to elected officials at both the state and federal levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Ahmad is facing in his district is happening across the U.S., as teacher shortages are becoming increasingly dire. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/how-many-teachers-are-leaving.htm">Dept. of Labor Statistics</a>, more than 270,000 public school teachers are projected to leave the profession between 2016 and 2026. A poll conducted by a well-known national teachers union <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/safety-concerns-over-covid-19-driving-some-educators-out">showed</a> that 1 and 3 teachers said it is likely they will retire or resign earlier than planned due to the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints in Ahmad's district has been a freeze on raises. "Every year, your salary is supposed to go up," said Ahmad. "Except, in the last few years that hasn't happened. And if you include inflation, we’ve essentially been getting pay cuts."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are "spiraling out of control," said Ahmad. His county is directly feeling the impact of the teacher shortage. He said, "there are so many people who would be great teachers who are choosing not to join the profession because teachers aren't being compensated fairly. We have so many openings, and we just have put a warm body in there because no one wants the job."</p>
<p>While workers across several industries are quitting, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm">Dept. of Labor</a>, 30,000 public school teachers left their jobs in September alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pattern is not new one. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/11/18/todays-teacher-shortages-are-part-longer-pattern/">The Washington Post</a>, teachers have been asking for fairer wages and higher respect for decades. School district leaders continue to make it difficult for teachers to be heard. Then, they resort to hiring substitutes or emergency licensed teachers to make up for shortages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These shortages aren't confined to the classroom, as reported by <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/schools-across-the-country-are-struggling-to-find-staff-heres-why">PBS</a>—from cafeteria workers to bus drivers, schools are experiencing shortages of all sorts of support staff. At least one school paid students to serve school lunches during the school day due to the staff.</p>
<p>As Ahmad said, students "aren’t learning" because of the lack of qualified teachers there. He also said that there are a number of goods and services that are provided from schools for students, such as "a warm meal," and mental health services. "If schools can’t provide those, because of a lack of funding or staff, then who will?"</p>
