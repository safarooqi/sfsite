As a student journalist, I have conducted countless interviews in order to produce original reporting on the issues most affecting our communities---whether within the media itself, or during social phenomenon such as 'Striketober.' Below is a sample article about Striketober, which I was able to write by interviewing public servants in the DMV area. I have also linked my portfolios in MediaFile and the GW Hatchet.

## MediaFile Articles

While at MediaFileDC, a student run online paper, I I conducted original reporting by speaking to various academics and experts while covering stories on the international beat. At MediaFile, the goal for reporters is to find stories with some sort of media lens---for example, my [stories](https://www.mediafiledc.com/author/sfarooqi/) ranged from the Western media coverage of Afghan women, to the media scrutiny Meghan Markle faced from the UK press.

## GW Hatchet Articles

At The Hatchet, I covered two [stories](https://www.gwhatchet.com/author/samiha-farooqi/) on campus involving the implentation of GW's u-pass program, and the student and university responses to an assault, interviewing several students in the process.
